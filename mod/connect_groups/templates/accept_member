Hi <username>,

Welcome!
Membership Officials have approved your openSUSE membership application.

Blog, mail address and irc cloak - if you requested them - will be updated
soon. Mail address should work within the next few hours. 

Your email alias is: <email_alias>
and will get redirected to: <email_target>

For cloak and blog it may take up to 10 days till it is set up. If the blog is
set up you'll receive an email and your openSUSE/member cloak you see when
you're logging into Freenode. If you encounter issues with mail, IRC or blog
please send an email to admin@opensuse.org

We kindly ask you - if not happened yet - to set up a user page [1] in the
openSUSE wiki to share some information about you with the broader openSUSE
community.

Thanks for being part of openSUSE!

Best Regards
Membership Officials
