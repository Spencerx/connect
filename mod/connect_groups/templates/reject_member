Hi <username>,

everybody is welcome to participate and get involved in the openSUSE
project and we grant membership for those that have shown a continued
and substantial contribution to the openSUSE project.
Membership officials have rejected your application since that does not
apply to you. We just found too little contribution and encourage you
to get more involved with openSUSE and then apply again for membership.

As a person new to openSUSE you might check the "How to Participate"
which gives a variety of possibilities,
http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate to start contributing. Or
you join our bi-weekly project meeting to see what' going on,
http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Meetings

If you disagree with the decision, please send an email to
membership-officials@opensuse.org

You can start contributing to openSUSE right away, you do not need to
become a recognized openSUSE member,

Best Regards,
Membership officials
